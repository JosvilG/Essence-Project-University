## General info
In Essence we seek to create an open world with secrets and puzzles, enemies to defeat, a boss with attack patterns and random movements, a basic loot system and the integration of a map.

In this project I was focused on modeling, level design and animation creation. But I also participated in parts of the programming such as the attack system, the animation system, and the sound.

## Â¡Important!

It was carried out for two months with the participation of five students. GitHub was not used in this project and not all students had a passion for the project as it was not something they liked. For this reason, the files are likely to be messy, as each student did their part and it was all brought together in one final file.

Tried to fix and organize files, but when doing this update, all files within Unity should be redirected.
